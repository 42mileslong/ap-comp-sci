MathSet
Coded by Rafi Long

===

Basic information:

Documentation is in the source headers.

===

Assignment:

Write a class MathSet that implements the Set interface, write union and intersection methods for it.

===

Implementation:

Instead of implementing every method in Set, as it is an interface, I also extended TreeSet, which allowed me to only write the methods union and intersection. This saved me a lot of work, as I do not have to write methods that have already been created by someone else.
