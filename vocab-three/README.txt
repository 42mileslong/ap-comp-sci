Explanation:

String
  A string is a data structure that can hold characters and or numbers to be able to be read, printed, or used in any other way.
  I implemented a String in my code that uses a graph in order to store data as characters.

Graph
  A graph is a form of a collection where nodes hold data, and edges connect one node to another.
  I implemented a node in my Node class, where datum can be stored in the form of an object.

Collection
  A collection is a set of data sorted in a retrievable, or useable, way.
  I implemented a collection as my graph, as it is a form of a collection.
