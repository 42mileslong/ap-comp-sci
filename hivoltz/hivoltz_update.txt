Hivoltz Project

Currently my Hivoltz project doesn't have much in the way of code, but I have practically all of my design planned out.

At first I was having difficulties figuring out how to avoid using number to denominate different objects in the grid. For a while I was considering creating a new class for every type of object that could be in the grid, but I realized that wouldn't work because I would have to create an individual grid for each type of object. I then realized that I could use enums to differentiate between different objects, and on initialization create an array of the mhos, an array of fences, and a variable for the player. This create a new problem, because each mho, fence, and player is a space on the tile. It is not possible to move the tiles, so when each character moves I will have to reassign the variables in the arrays. However, this approach is much more specialized than having a number signifying each different type of object, and having arrays of the special objects is much faster than having to search through the whole grid for the objects.

It might be worrying to you that I still don't have any visuals, but I would like to remind you that the same was true of my flag project, and that my flag project turned out very well.
