/**
 * Answers to question 5 in ThinkAPJava chapter 15
 * http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/thinkapjava.pdf
 *
 * Chapter 15. Object-oriented programming
 *
 * 1. Start with http://thinkapjava.com/code/CardSoln3.java and
 * make sure you can compile and run it.
 *
 * 2. Write a definition for a class named PokerHand that extends Deck.
 *
 * 3. Write a Deck method named deal that creates a PokerHand, transfers
 * cards from the deck to the hand, and returns the hand.
 *
 * 4. In main use shuffle and deal to generate and print four PokerHands
 * with five cards each. Did you get anything good?
 *
 * 6. Write a method called hasThreeKind that indicates whether the hand
 * contains Three of a Kind.
 *
 * 7. Write a loop that generates a few thousand hands and checks whether
 * they contain a flush or three of a kind. Estimate the probability of
 * getting one of those hands. Compare your results to the probabilities
 * at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands.
 *
 * 8. Write methods that test for the other poker hands. Some are easier
 * than others. You might find it useful to write some general-purpose
 * helper methods that can be used for more than one test.
 *
 * 9. In some poker games, players get seven cards each, and they form a
 * hand with the best five of the seven. Modify your program to generate
 * seven-card hands and recompute the probabilities.
